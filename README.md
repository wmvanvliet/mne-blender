Visualizing brain activity in Blender
=====================================

This is a script that you can run inside Blender. It will attempt to import
MNE-Python and load an example source estimate file. Based on the source
estimate a mesh with animated texture will be added to your scene. Be sure to
set your viewport into "shaded mode" so view the texture.

At the moment, you need to read the code to see what it actually does and
how.
